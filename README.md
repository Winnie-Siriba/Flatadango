# **Flatdango** 🎥  

Flatdango is a dynamic single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse movies, view their details, and purchase tickets. The project uses a `json-server` to simulate a backend and provides an interactive user experience to manage movie tickets.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Winnie-Siriba/Flatadango.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Flatadango

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the JSON Server to run the mock API:
   ```bash
